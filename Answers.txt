B) 
C) Dash - a Python based framework would allow us to quickly design a layout. Its callbacks allow for parsing user input easily and passing it onto the backend for the calculations. Dash which is based off of flask can be conveniently deployed using Heroku. Heroku makes for an excellent choice for deployment of applications just as long as the task is computationally inexpensive. Heroku's free deployment is extremely limited and applications which deal in big-data would fail. One of my applications deployed on Heroku failed to run as the backend was too heavy and required more than the provided 500MB of ram. The deployment was then shifted to GCP. GCP's requirement to containerize the application can be challenging at times but GCP provides comparitively greater computer resources in the free version.
